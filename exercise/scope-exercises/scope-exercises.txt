1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out(without running it):
x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function (a, b, c) {
    var x = 10;
    document.write(x);  // 10
    document.write(a);  // 8
    var f = function (a, b, c) {
        b = a;
        document.write(b);  // 8
        b = c;
        var x = 5;
    }
    f(a, b, c);
    document.write(b);  // 9
}
c(8, 9, 10);
document.write(b);  // 10
document.write(x);  // 1
}

2. What is the difference between a method and function?
Methods are functions stored as object properties. A function is a block of code written to perform some specific set of tasks.

3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method ?
this refers to the object itself.
     
4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method ?
references the object that is currently calling the function.

5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?
refers to the newly created object.

6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript.Object x has a method f() containing keyword 'this'.
When f is called by x.f(), what does 'this' refer to ?
this refers to object x since f() is being called with x.f(), if it was y.f() then this would refer to object y

7. What is a free variable in JavaScript ?
a free variable is a variable that comes outside of the current function. Variables that are neither declared nor passed as a parameter to the function.

8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major = "music" and a property that is a function
that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.
let x = {
    name: "fred",
    major: "music",
    compute: function(a, b) {
        if(a == b) return a * b;
        return a < b ? a : b;
    }
}

9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.
function Employee(name, salary, position) {
    this.name = name;
    this.salary = salary;
    this.position = position;
}
let emp1 = new Employee("Joe", 100, "Manager");
let emp2 = new Employee("Jane", 75, "Sales");
let emp3 = new Employee("Dave", 60, "Security");

10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments.
function product() {
    let product = 0;
    for(let i=0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
        product += arguments[i];
    }
    return product;
}

11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.
let max = (x,y,z) => Math.max(x,y,z);
