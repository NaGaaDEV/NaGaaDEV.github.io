1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
setTimeout(booyah, 2000);   // calls the booyah function after 2000ms
setTimeout(booyah(), 2000); // calls the booyah function immediately 

2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
var myfunc = function(a, x) {
 return a * x;
};
var x = myfunc(2, 3);
var y = myfunc;
alert(x);   // 6
alert(y(2,3));  // 6

3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
says “BOOYAH!”
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);

function booyah1() { alert("BOOYAH!")}
function booyah2() { 
	return function() { alert("BOOYAH!") }; 
}

4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
